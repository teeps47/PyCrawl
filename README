This is a very basic Python based web crawler. It was built for 50apps.org Week 1 to experiment with building a python app.

Only the 'simple' parts have been implemented due to time constraints. It is likely I will come back later to add the advanced app requirements.

Feel free to contact me about this at tom@tjpeters.org
